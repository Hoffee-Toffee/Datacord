Dollar signs. Money.

853
01:15:28.454 --> 01:15:31.916
I didn’t build this ship
to usher in a new era for humanity.

854
01:15:32.667 --> 01:15:37.505
You think I want to go to the stars?
I don’t even like to fly! I take trains!

855
01:15:39.381 --> 01:15:43.302
I built this ship so that I could retire
to some tropical island

856
01:15:44.636 --> 01:15:47.848
filled with naked women.

857
01:15:48.432 --> 01:15:51.809
That’s Zefram Cochrane.
That’s his vision.

858
01:15:52.768 --> 01:15:56.606
This other guy you keep talking about,
this historical figure,

859
01:15:58.106 --> 01:15:59.690
I never met him.

860
01:16:00.399 --> 01:16:02.526
I can’t imagine I ever will.

861
01:16:04.236 --> 01:16:08.407
Someone once said, “Don’t try to be
a great man. Just be a man,

862
01:16:08.949 --> 01:16:11.243
“and let history
make its own judgments.”

863
01:16:11.327 --> 01:16:13.412
That’s rhetorical nonsense.

864
01:16:15.204 --> 01:16:18.791
- Who said that?
- You did, ten years from now.

865
01:16:20.083 --> 01:16:23.670
You got 58 minutes, Doc.
You better get on that checklist.

866
01:16:25.172 --> 01:16:26.672
They’re on the move again.

867
01:16:26.756 --> 01:16:28.340
The Borg just overran
three of our defense checkpoints.

868
01:16:29.341 --> 01:16:31.343
They’ve taken over Decks 5 and 6.

869
01:16:31.426 --> 01:16:33.218
They’ve adapted
to every modulation of our weapons.

870
01:16:33.302 --> 01:16:34.845
It’s like we’re shooting blanks.

871
01:16:34.929 --> 01:16:36.263
We’ll have to work
on finding another way

872
01:16:36.347 --> 01:16:39.183
to modify our weapons
so they’ll be more effective.

873
01:16:39.266 --> 01:16:42.519
In the meantime,
tell your men to stand their ground.

874
01:16:42.603 --> 01:16:45.230
- Sir...
- Fight hand-to-hand if they have to.

875
01:16:47.024 --> 01:16:48.275
Aye, sir.

876
01:16:52.028 --> 01:16:54.613
Wait.
Captain, our weapons are useless.

877
01:16:54.696 --> 01:16:56.698
We must activate
the auto-destruct sequence

878
01:16:56.782 --> 01:16:58.909
and use the escape pods
to evacuate the ship.

879
01:16:58.992 --> 01:17:00.035
No!

880
01:17:00.619 --> 01:17:03.372
Jean-Luc, if we destroy the ship,
we destroy the Borg.

881
01:17:04.164 --> 01:17:05.666
We’re gonna stay and fight.

882
01:17:05.749 --> 01:17:08.710
Sir, we have lost the <i>Enterprise</i>.
We should not sacrifice...

883
01:17:08.794 --> 01:17:10.586
We have not lost
the <i>Enterprise</i>, Mr. Worf.

884
01:17:10.670 --> 01:17:12.296
We are not going to lose the <i>Enterprise</i>.

885
01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.589
Not to the Borg,
not while I’m in command.

886
01:17:14.673 --> 01:17:17.509
- You have your orders.
- I must object to this course of action.

887
01:17:17.592 --> 01:17:18.802
- It is...
- The objection is noted.

888
01:17:18.885 --> 01:17:20.637
With all due respect, sir,

889
01:17:21.346 --> 01:17:24.599
I believe you are allowing
your personal experience with the Borg

890
01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:26.810
to influence your judgment.

891
01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:29.980
You’re afraid.

892
01:17:31.022 --> 01:17:33.775
You want to destroy the ship
and run away. You coward.

893
01:17:33.942 --> 01:17:35.234
DR. CRUSHER: Jean-Luc.

894
01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:40.906
If you were any other man,
I would kill you where you stand.

895
01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:43.033
Get off my Bridge.

896
01:17:57.756 --> 01:18:00.175
- So what do we do now?
- We carry out his orders.

897
01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:01.968
Dyson, Kaplan,

898
01:18:02.051 --> 01:18:03.052
- start working on a way to modify...
- Wait!

899
01:18:03.136 --> 01:18:04.344
- ...the weapon systems.
- This is stupid!

900
01:18:04.428 --> 01:18:07.347
If we can get off this ship
and then blow it up, let’s do it!

901
01:18:07.431 --> 01:18:09.766
Once the Captain’s made up his mind,
the discussion is over.

902
01:18:10.308 --> 01:18:11.351
Lily!

903
01:18:14.271 --> 01:18:17.107
- You son of a bitch.
- This really isn’t the time.

904
01:18:17.691 --> 01:18:20.527
Okay, I don’t know jack
about the 24th century,

905
01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:22.612
but everybody out there thinks
that staying here

906
01:18:22.696 --> 01:18:24.196
and fighting the Borg is suicide.

907
01:18:24.321 --> 01:18:26.073
They’re just afraid to come in here
and say it.

908
01:18:26.157 --> 01:18:28.534
The crew is accustomed
to following my orders.

909
01:18:28.617 --> 01:18:30.953
They’re probably accustomed
to your orders making sense.

910
01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.873
None of them
understand the Borg as I do.

911
01:18:35.624 --> 01:18:37.000
No one does.

912
01:18:38.126 --> 01:18:39.334
No one can.

913
01:18:39.668 --> 01:18:41.295
What is that supposed to mean?

914
01:18:46.341 --> 01:18:50.763
Six years ago,
they assimilated me into their collective.

915
01:18:52.931 --> 01:18:56.643
I had their cybernetic devices
implanted throughout my body.

916
01:18:57.186 --> 01:19:01.815
I was linked to the hive mind,
every trace of individuality erased.

917
01:19:03.817 --> 01:19:05.235
I was one of them.

918
01:19:06.737 --> 01:19:07.988
So you can imagine, my dear,

919
01:19:08.072 --> 01:19:10.365
I have a somewhat unique perspective
on the Borg,

920
01:19:10.449 --> 01:19:12.576
and I know how to fight them.

921
01:19:12.659 --> 01:19:14.828
Now, if you will excuse me,
I have work to do.

922
01:19:16.872 --> 01:19:18.664
I am such an idiot.

923
01:19:22.293 --> 01:19:23.795
It’s so simple.

924
01:19:24.253 --> 01:19:27.882
The Borg hurt you,
and now you’re going to hurt them back.

925
01:19:28.591 --> 01:19:31.010
In my century,
we don’t succumb to revenge.

926
01:19:31.094 --> 01:19:33.179
We have a more evolved sensibility.

927
01:19:33.262 --> 01:19:35.348
Bullshit! I saw the look on your face

928
01:19:35.431 --> 01:19:38.016
when you shot those Borg
on the Holodeck.

929
01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:40.227
You were almost enjoying it!

930
01:19:43.105 --> 01:19:45.357
- How dare you.
- Oh, come on, Captain.

931
01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.609
You’re not the first man
to get a thrill from murdering someone.

932
01:19:48.692 --> 01:19:50.360
I see it all the time!

933
01:19:50.443 --> 01:19:51.986
- Get out!
- Or what?

934
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:55.657
You’ll kill me
like you killed Ensign Lynch?

935
01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:58.535
- There was no way to save him.
- You didn’t even try.

936
01:19:58.618 --> 01:20:01.037
Where was
your evolved sensibility then?

937
01:20:01.121 --> 01:20:03.373
- I don’t have time for this.
- Hey.

938
01:20:03.623 --> 01:20:07.085
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean
to interrupt your little quest.

939
01:20:07.168 --> 01:20:09.796
Captain Ahab has to go hunt his whale.

940
01:20:12.507 --> 01:20:13.550
What?

941
01:20:13.925 --> 01:20:16.678
You do have books in the 24th century?

942
01:20:18.221 --> 01:20:19.805
- This is not about revenge.
- Liar!

943
01:20:19.888 --> 01:20:21.890
This is about saving
the future of humanity!

944
01:20:21.974 --> 01:20:24.726
- Jean-Luc, blow up the damn ship!
- No!

945
01:20:26.102 --> 01:20:27.394
No!

946
01:20:40.407 --> 01:20:42.909
I will not sacrifice the <i>Enterprise</i>.

947
01:20:44.035 --> 01:20:47.747
We’ve made too many compromises
already, too many retreats.

948
01:20:49.207 --> 01:20:51.960
They invade our space and we fall back.

949
01:20:53.170 --> 01:20:56.547
They assimilate entire worlds
and we fall back.

950
01:20:57.381 --> 01:20:58.673
Not again.

951
01:20:58.756 --> 01:21:02.594
The line must be drawn here.
This far, no further!

952
01:21:04.929 --> 01:21:09.517
And I will make them pay
for what they’ve done.

953
01:21:35.293 --> 01:21:36.877
You broke your little ships.

954
01:21:48.138 --> 01:21:49.973
See you around, Ahab.

955
01:21:53.602 --> 01:21:56.313

the whale’s white hump

felt by his whole race.

957
01:22:03.153 --> 01:22:07.491
“If his chest had been a cannon,
he would have shot his heart upon it.”

958
01:22:08.242 --> 01:22:09.326

01:22:12.495 --> 01:22:13.829
<i>Moby-Dick.

Actually, I never read it.

961
01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:28.260
Ahab spent years hunting
the white whale that crippled him,

962
01:22:29.511 --> 01:22:31.346
a quest for vengeance,

963
01:22:32.597 --> 01:22:38.103
but in the end,
it destroyed him and his ship.

964
01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:43.858
